DCC natively supports data types including **integer, decimal, double-precision decimal, logical, text, and large number** data types. For constant expressions, DCC also has corresponding symbols to describe the data type of constants.

For numbers, just write them directly. Whether it's a decimal will be intelligently judged based on the surrounding code. For text types, use full-width or half-width quotes (see examples in the Sensitivity chapter). For the four keywords true, false, TRUE, FALSE (case-insensitive), they are considered logical data (boolean type).
