First revised on October 8, 2025

### Article 1 - Formulation Basis

&emsp;The formulation of this regulation complies with the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and relevant laws and regulations.

### Article 2 - Scope of Application

&emsp;Anyone who joins this group represents that they agree with this regulation and are willing to comply with it. Any group member shall not violate the group regulation for any reason, otherwise they will be subject to corresponding penalties.

### Article 3 - Penalty Methods

&emsp;Based on factors such as different rules violated and different degrees of impact caused, the following one or more penalties will be imposed on those who violate the regulations:

- Mute from one minute to one month
- Removal of administrator status
- Verbal education
- Warning
- Serious warning
- Removal from the group chat
- Removal from the group chat and blacklisting
- Report to QQ official
- Report to relevant national authorities

&emsp;Among them, the penalty measure of being removed from the group chat allows members to rejoin, which is used to clear the group chat level.

### Article 4 - Handling of Inappropriate Content

&emsp;Those who publish content that clearly violates national laws and regulations in the group (including but not limited to content related to pornography, gambling, drugs; illegal disclosure of household registration information; insulting martyrs) will be removed from the group and blacklisted, and reported to relevant national authorities at the same time.

&emsp;When communicating, those who obviously discuss sensitive topics related to current politics and cause more than twenty-five messages to participate in the discussion will be muted for more than one day. Those who repeatedly fail to correct will be given heavier penalties.

&emsp;Due to the difficulty of definition, whether relevant content is inappropriate to be sent will be jointly judged by the group owner and administrators. Currently, the clearly prohibited content includes: spreading political rumors, separatist remarks, and unverified major events.

### Article 5 - Spamming Content

&emsp;Anyone who continuously sends a large amount of useless, repetitive information without interruption, or uses special technical means to make images and other content occupy a long space, will be muted for more than one hour. Those who repeatedly fail to correct will be given heavier penalties.

### Article 6 - Disrupting Harmony

&emsp;Those who engage in regional discrimination, racial discrimination, or malicious personal attacks, ridicule, and other behaviors that are not conducive to unity within the group will be muted for more than one day. Those who are serious or repeatedly fail to correct will be given heavier penalties.

### Article 7 - Restrictions on Promotion

&emsp;Without the permission of the group owner or administrators, those who publish profit-oriented advertisements, files, texts, URLs, etc. that are unrelated to the group chat discussion content and cause more than five group members to clearly express disgust will be removed from the group chat and blacklisted.

### Article 8 - Abolition and Punishment of Administrators

&emsp;If an administrator fails to impose penalties on group members in accordance with regulations due to personal emotions or other factors, or handles corresponding violations improperly, they should adjust the handling results of the incident and be given a verbal warning. If this happens more than twice, their administrator status should be removed.

&emsp;If an administrator violates the group chat regulations, their administrator status should be removed and they should be subject to a penalty that is one level heavier than the ordinary penalty.

&emsp;When an administrator handles group affairs, if they use obviously insulting and offensive words to others, their administrator status should be removed; if they use sarcastic language or have a bad attitude, they will be persuaded to correct their attitude, and if such situations occur again, their administrator status will be removed.

### Article 9 - Refusing to Accept Education

&emsp;After violating the regulations, those who express dissatisfaction and refuse to admit their mistakes under the education of administrators or the group owner should be given heavier penalties.

### Article 10 - Taking the Initiative to Admit Mistakes

&emsp;After violating the regulations, those who take the initiative to admit their mistakes and apologize under the persuasion of administrators, the group owner, or other group members should be given lighter penalties. Those who take the initiative to apologize without being educated will have their penalties reduced by two levels, which can be reduced to no penalty status.

### Article 11 - Preprocessing Measures

&emsp;In cases where there may be or are confirmed violations and the group chat is relatively chaotic, administrators or the group owner can temporarily set a one-hour mute for all parties involved. During this period, all online administrators and the group owner will jointly determine whether there is a violation or which penalty measure should be applied, and adjustments can be made after discussion.

### Management Notes: How Penalties are Increased

2025.10.8 First Edition

&emsp;For items marked with "those who repeatedly fail to correct will be given heavier penalties" or "those who are serious and repeatedly fail to correct will be given heavier penalties", and for those who meet the provisions of Article 10 or 11 of this regulation, the basis for increasing or reducing penalties is based on the order of the following list:

1. Mute for one minute (or more)

2. Mute for five minutes (or more)

3. Mute for one hour (or more)

4. Mute for twelve hours (or more)

5. Mute for one day (or more)

6. Mute for ten days (or more)

7. Mute for one month (29 days 23 hours 59 minutes)

8. Removal from the group chat and blacklisting

&emsp;For first-time offenders, penalties will be imposed in the manner and duration specified in the violated regulation. For subsequent violations, the next level of punishment from the original item will be applied, and so on. Additional aggravation means using the next level on this basis, while mitigation is the opposite. Aggravation and mitigation can be叠加.

&emsp;Each time a mute is imposed, it should be selected above the current level and below the next level. Exceeding the range will be considered as administrator dereliction of duty.

&emsp;For those who violate multiple regulations at the same time, the cumulative method will be adopted to calculate the total duration of mute that should be applied. If the total duration exceeds one month (29 days 23 hours 59 minutes), it will be integrated into removal from the group chat and blacklisting and executed.
