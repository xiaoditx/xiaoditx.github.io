## Prerequisites

To compile 64-bit programs, the following software is required:

- GNU make (can be called via the `make` command, requires version 4.4.x or higher)

- g++ (can be called via the `g++` command, minimum support for C++17 syntax)

- windres.exe (can be called via the `windres` command)

To compile 32-bit programs, g++ is not required, but a 32-bit g++ is needed, which can be called in the form of the `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` command. If it's not this name, please modify the tenth line of the makefile:

```make
CXX      = i686-w64-mingw32-g++
```

If you want to compile the installer, the following software is required:

- Inno Setup (preferably can be called using the `iscc` command)

## Compile the Software Main Body

Use the command `make` in the root directory to compile the software main body. Wait for it to complete, then go to `./build/64/` to check the compilation results.

For specific usage details of make, please use `make help` or go to [makefileHelper.txt](makefileHelper.txt) to view.

## Compile the Software Installer

Use `iscc /DMyAppArch="64" installer.iss` in the root directory to generate the 64-bit software installer. The file name is `./build/installer/installer_x64.exe`

Use `iscc /DMyAppArch="32" installer.iss` in the root directory to generate the 32-bit software installer. The file name is `./build/installer/installer_x86.exe`

> [!note]
> You can also use Inno Setup's GUI editor to open installer.iss for compilation, but in this case, to compile a 32-bit installer, you need to modify the content of installer.iss
