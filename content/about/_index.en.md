## About this website

This is my personal website, build with [hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra). Thanks to the open source authors for their contributions.

## About me


A content creater on Bilibili,and a C++/EasyLanguage programmer who enjoys delving into WIN32 and various low-level technologies. I have an instinctive aversion to third-party libraries (oddly enough) and still consider myself relatively new in these fields.

I enjoy being part of the open-source community, with a preference for the WTFPL license.
